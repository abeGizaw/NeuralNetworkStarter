# Neural Network Starter Project

This project is an exploration into the field of artificial neural networks. It is inspired by the YouTube series "Neural Networks from Scratch" by sentdex. The aim is to understand the fundamentals of neural networks and implement them from the ground up using Python.

## Overview

The project includes the creation of a simple neural network capable of learning and making predictions. The network is built without the use of high-level machine learning libraries to grasp the underlying mechanics of neural computations and backpropagation.

## Features

- Implementation of a basic neural network with customizable layers and neurons.
- Functions for forward propagation and backpropagation.
- Sample training data for testing and evaluation.

## Usage

To run the neural network:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the main script using Python.

```bash
git clone [Repository_Link]
cd [Project_Directory]
python main.py
```
