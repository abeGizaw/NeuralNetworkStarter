# Neural Network Starter Project

This project is an exploration into the field of artificial neural networks. It is inspired by the YouTube series "Neural Networks from Scratch" by sentdex and the book **Neural Networks From Scratch In Python**. The aim is to understand the fundamentals of neural networks and implement them from the ground up using Python.

## Overview

The project includes the creation of a simple neural network capable of learning and making predictions. The network is built without the use of high-level machine learning libraries such as keras to grasp the underlying mechanics of neural computations and backpropagation.

## Features

- Implementation of a basic neural network with customizable layers and neurons.
- Functions for forward propagation and backpropagation.
- Sample training data for testing and evaluation.

## Acknowledgments
